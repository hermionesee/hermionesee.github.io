                            A website that was designed for a beauty shopping website, with more nature-related colours.
                            With the idea of promoting how the company sells their products which are made with no harmful
                            ingredients.

                        <p class="service-item-text">
                            The idea was for a beauty website that uses natural products, thus the colour scheme leaned more
                            towards the shades of nature, having the earthy tone.

                        <h3>Home Page</h3>

                        <p>
                            The overall theme I tried to go for was more of an aesthetic colour, beige, to suit the main selling idea of the company.
                            In this case, I wanted to portray a company that sells naturally made products, thus the more earthy tones used.

                            Since the shop sells 2 main categories, I separated them so that the user can specifically find what they are looking for.

                    I wanted to come up with a beauty website that promotes its naturally made products, and have an aesthetic-looking
                    website as much as possible. I believe it is important to give a representation of what you want to sell to your
                    customers and show it on your website, similar to the branding of your brand.
