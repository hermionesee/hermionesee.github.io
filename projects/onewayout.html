                            For a school assignment, we had to create a 500 by 500 grid 2D escape room. We were able to add our
                            own theme and narrative and play around with our creativity with no particular restrictions besides
                            the fact that the room can only fit within the space, with an entrance and exit.

                            "Player stumbles into what looks like an abandoned factory and enters the backdoor to take a
                            look, accidentally triggering an ancient security protocol."

                        </br>

                            I aimed to create a thriller-inspired experience that evokes a sense of fear through atmosphere
                            alone—no jump scares, just an unsettling space that quietly gets under your skin, thus the overall
                            color scheme of the map.

                        <p>
                            I started with designing the room layout, organizing spaces into a logical
                            flow that guided players from the starting area through a series of rooms
                            to the final exit.

                        <p>
                            With the structure in place, I focused on puzzle implementation and routing, mapping
                            out the player’s journey and determining the sequence of challenges to ensure smooth
                            progression. I also worked on building atmosphere, adding visual and environmental
                            details to give each room its distinct personality and tone.

                            This was followed by placing interactable objects within the environment to enrich gameplay
                            and encourage exploration.

                        <p>
                            Finally, I conducted refinement and polish, adding small visual flairs, adjusting object
                            placements, and fine-tuning elements to create a cohesive and engaging escape room experience.

                <p>
                    I wanted to add a stronger sense of story to the escape room, not just through environmental puzzles but
                    also through interactable elements that provide players with context about the world they’re in. These details
                    help players piece together the narrative as they explore, deepening their immersion within the space. I also
                    aimed to ensure that each room played a meaningful role in unfolding the story, creating a cohesive and engaging
                    experience throughout the entire escape room.
